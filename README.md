# RemoteTopology
### Welcome to RT, it complex solution consisting of PHP site, service for establishing SSH connection, database with competitor and more
Notes
1. Connecting to virtual machines will be  established through VCSA
2. Connection to network devices will be established through SSH connection to console server
3. Competitors get access to RT over VPN connection
> VPN itself is not implemented as a separate service in RT, but sooner or later we will come to this :)
### Requirements
1. Server (Linux must haveðŸ˜€) with installed `docker` service
2. `VPN` Gateway (I recommend you AnyConnect connecion)
3. Installed `VCSA` and virtual machines with stands in ready state
4. `Console` server for connect to network devices
